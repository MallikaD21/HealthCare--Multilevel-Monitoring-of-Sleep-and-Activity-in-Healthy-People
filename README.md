Introduction: 
Sleep is an essential function that allows your body and mind to recharge, leaving you refreshed and alert when you wake up. 
Healthy sleep also helps the body remain healthy and stave off diseases. Without enough sleep, the brain cannot function properly. 
This can impair your abilities to concentrate, think clearly, and process memories. Most adults require at least seven hours of sleep 
per night for healthy cognitive and behavioural processes. A lack of sleep can have negative effects that are severe. Now-a-days due to busy schedule,

a lack of sleep has been associated with a higher risk for developing some illnesses and ailments. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease,
stroke, inadequate mental health, and premature death are a few of them.

Multilevel Monitoring of Activity and Sleep in Healthy people (MMASH) dataset provides 24 hours of continuous beat-to-beat heart data, triaxial accelerometer data,
sleep quality, physical activity and psychological characteristics (i.e., anxiety status, stress events and emotions) for 22 healthy participants. Moreover, saliva bio-markers 
(i.e. cortisol and melatonin) and activity log were also provided in this dataset. The MMASH dataset will enable researchers to test the correlations between physical activity, 
sleep quality, and psychological characteristics.

Objective:
To help people understand and fight with such indirect influence of lack of sleep we will see how different factors impact human health and how we can
improve the mental as well as physical effect of lack of sleep. Most of us are not getting enough high-quality sleep, which can lead to negative health 
outcomes. Collecting and leveraging data can be key to diagnosing sleep disorders and making targeted interventions to improve sleep. To raise awareness
